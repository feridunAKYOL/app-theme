# Project of app-theme
### TARGET
In this project we continued to our travel in **HTML5** and **CSS3**. We have 3 main target by doing such a project:  
>>* Learning steps in `git`; creating a `branch`, `pull request`, `push`, `commit`, `add`, `merge`  
>>* We try to learn that how we can create a more responsive page by using `flexboxgrid` and `Bootstrap` :dizzy_face:
>>* And of course develop in *HTML* and *CSS*
### INSPIRATION
Our project is depends on ["Build A Responsive HTML & CSS Template With FlexboxGrid" youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlA7dputiNc) from Traversy Media. Thank you very much Traversy Media :heartpulse:   
### SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT
In this projects I have learned how to use github and git. In any project I should make the project into small parts. Namely `Branching`.  
Also I have to add some features for `responsiveness`. I did not have any idea before.   
but I have struggled in using `flex` and `grid` and `responsiveness`.. It is better but should be perfect :muscle::fire:
